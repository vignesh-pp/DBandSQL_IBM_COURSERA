--Sub-queries and Nested SELECTs

from loaded datas

How does a typical Nested SELECT statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);
   
 1  Problem:

Execute a failing query (i.e. one which gives an error) to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
select * 
from employees 
where salary < AVG(salary);


2  Problem:

Execute a working query using a sub-select to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY 
from employees 
where SALARY < (select AVG(SALARY) 
                from employees);
                
                
 3 problem:
 
 Execute a failing query (i.e. one which gives an error) to retrieve all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.
 select EMP_ID, SALARY, MAX(SALARY) AS MAX_SALARY 
from employees;	

4 problems:

Execute a Column Expression that retrieves all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.
select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select MAX(SALARY) from employees ) AS MAX_SALARY 
from employees;

5 problems:

Execute a Table Expression for the EMPLOYEES table that excludes columns with sensitive employee data (i.e. does not include columns: SSN, B_DATE, SEX, ADDRESS, SALARY).
select * from ( select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID from employees) AS EMP4ALL;
