Exercise 1: Create the Pet Rescue table
-- Drop the PETRESCUE table in case it exists
drop table PETRESCUE;
-- Create the PETRESCUE table 
create table PETRESCUE (
	ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
	ANIMAL VARCHAR(20),
	QUANTITY INTEGER,
	COST DECIMAL(6,2),
	RESCUEDATE DATE,
	PRIMARY KEY (ID)
	);
-- Insert sample data into PETRESCUE table
insert into PETRESCUE values 
	(1,'Cat',9,450.09,'2018-05-29'),
	(2,'Dog',3,666.66,'2018-06-01'),
	(3,'Dog',1,100.00,'2018-06-04'),
	(4,'Parrot',2,50.00,'2018-06-04'),
	(5,'Dog',1,75.75,'2018-06-10'),
	(6,'Hamster',6,60.60,'2018-06-11'),
	(7,'Cat',1,44.44,'2018-06-11'),
	(8,'Goldfish',24,48.48,'2018-06-14'),
	(9,'Dog',2,222.22,'2018-06-15');

Exercise 2 Solutions: Aggregate Functions
Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.

select SUM(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.

select SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST from PETRESCUE;

Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.

select MAX(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;

Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.

select AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog. Hint - Bear in my the cost of rescuing one dog on day, is different from another day. So you will have to use and average of averages.

select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';

Exercise 3 Solutions: Scalar and String Functions
Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.

select ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.

select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;

Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.

select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;

Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.

select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;

Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.

select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';

Exercise 4 Solutions: Date and Time Functions
Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.

select DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Cat';

Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.

select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';

Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.

select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)='14';

Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.

select (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) from PETRESCUE;

Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the recue date.

select (CURRENT DATE - RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;
